I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and a passion for building scalable, high-performance web applications using React. Over the years, I’ve delivered impact across a wide range of projects—from high-traffic media portals and SaaS dashboards to internal design systems and AI-powered tools.

I’ve implemented smart/dumb component patterns, optimized applications with lazy loading (WebP/SVG, deferred scripts), and enhanced user experience using browser caching, CDNs, and synthetic monitoring tools like Lighthouse and Dynatrace.

Some highlights from my work:

* Developed a reusable Micro Frontend (MFE) to unify shared functionality across modules using event-driven communication and session storage.
* Built a task dashboard with optimistic UI updates, ensuring immediate client-side feedback and graceful error handling for failed API calls.
* Created data-rich analytics dashboards using React, REST, GraphQL, and Recharts—currently migrating to GraphQL for better maintainability and performance.
* Optimized real-time systems during a live event surge (250k+ concurrent users), dynamically switching from WebSockets to polling, disabling non-critical features, and virtualizing heavy components to sustain performance.
* Migrated app-wide state management from Context API to Redux using a progressive rollout with feature flags to improve load time and eliminate unnecessary re-renders.
* Co-created a React-compatible design system (from vanilla JS) following Atomic Design principles; used JSCodeShift for codemods and Storybook for shared testing and documentation. Published the system to a private NPM registry.

Personal Trivia:

* I once live-debugged a production bug during an Oscar event spike while explaining it to my family over dinner.
* I love exploring how ancient spiritual traditions overlap with modern science—and I share those reflections on YouTube.
* My idea of fun includes tweaking React performance at 2 AM *and* binge-watching documentaries on time travel.
* I’ve been told I name my variables better than I name my houseplants. (RIP Ferny McFernface.)
