# Yamini's Alter Ego â€“ Interactive AI Chat Agent

An intelligent, chat-based AI agent built with Python and Gradio that represents me on my personal website. It answers questions about my skills, experience, and background, acting as a real-time interactive assistant.

## Key Features

* **OpenAI Function Calling for Intent Detection & Actions**
  The agent understands user intent beyond simple chat and can take meaningful actions.

  * For example, if you express interest in collaboration, it will prompt for your email and trigger a background function that sends me an instant push notification.
  * If it encounters a question it cannot answer, the agent logs it for me to review and improve later.

* **Experience Summarization**
  Summarizes my professional experience by referencing my LinkedIn PDF and a custom summary file, providing concise and relevant responses.

* **Real-Time Alerts**
  Sends immediate notifications via the Pushover API when important follow-ups or actions are triggered.

* **Deployment & UI**
  Hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yamini-suman/yamini-ai-agent) with a clean and user-friendly interface that automatically handles user messages.
